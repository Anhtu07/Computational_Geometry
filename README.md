# Computational_Geometry
Implement Algorithm and Data Structure in Computational Geometry

This code focuses on implemting sweeping lines algorithm described in Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications (by Mark de Berg)

Folder line_intersecting contains code for finding all intersections of every segments in 2D planes with time complexity O(k log n)
where k is the number of intersections and number of segments

DCEL jupyter notebook, create DCEL structure of plane graph and generate random DCEL structure for testing subdivion intersection algorithm
